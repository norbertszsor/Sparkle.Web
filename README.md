## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.17.1 recommended)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) (v16.2.1 recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sparkle-web.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd sparkle-web
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the local development server:

   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

   Access the application at [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/).

2. Use the interface to perform energy usage forecasting based on provided data.

## Deployment

To deploy Sparkle.Web manually, follow these steps:

Configure the API address for Sparkle.Core in the environment.prod.ts file located at src/environments/environment.prod.ts. Update the apiUrl field with the valid API address:

```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: true,
  apiUrl: 'https://your-sparkle-core-api-address.com/api',
};
```

This step is essential for the live version to communicate with the Sparkle.Core API.

1. Build the Angular application using the Angular CLI:

   ```bash
   ng build --prod
   ```

   This will create a production-ready build of your application in the `dist/` directory.

2. Deploy the contents of the `dist/` directory to your web server or hosting platform of choice.

3. Ensure that your web server is properly configured to serve the static files from the `dist/` directory.

4. Once deployed, users can access the live version of Sparkle.Web at the appropriate URL.

Remember to configure your web server or hosting platform to handle any server-side routing necessary for your Angular application.

For more advanced deployment options, consider automating the build and deployment process using CI/CD pipelines.
